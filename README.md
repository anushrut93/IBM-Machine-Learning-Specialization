# IBM_ML_Specialization

This repository contains 6 projects that I finished as part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. 
Each project corresponds to one of these 6 courses that together comprise this specialization:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning
2. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
3. Supervised Machine Learning: Classification
4. Unsupervised Machine Learning
5. Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
6. Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis

For each of the projects, the students were required to find a relevant dataset from Kaggle. 
The dataset I used for each of the projects is included in the relevant folder.
Besides, each folder contains an Ipynb that contains the code for the project as well a pdf file which is a summarized report of the project.
